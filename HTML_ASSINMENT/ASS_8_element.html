    <h1>HTML Elements Showcase – Inline vs Block</h1>
<p> <b>Block elements</b> (e.g., &lt;div&gt;, &lt;P&gt;,  &lt;section&gt) start on a new line and stretch across the full width. They're used to build the skeleton of a page—like paragraphs, headers, or containers. <br>
 <b>Inline elements</b> (e.g., &lt;span&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;) sit within lines of text and only take up as much space as needed. They're perfect for styling or linking small parts of content without breaking the flow.</p>
