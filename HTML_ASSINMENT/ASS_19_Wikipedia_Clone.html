        <p>The first introduction of a mutual fund in India occurred in 1963, when the Government of India launched the
            Unit Trust of India (UTI).[1] Mutual funds are broadly categorised into three segments: equity funds, hybrid
            funds, and debt funds.</p>

                    over a six-fold increase compared to the ₹8.26 trillion (US$98 billion) recorded in December 2013.

                <h4>2020 Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund fiasco<sub>[edit]</sub></h4>
                <p>
                    In April 2020, Franklin Templeton India unexpectedly wound up six credit funds with assets of close
                    to $4 billion, citing a lack of liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic. These funds had large
                    exposure to higher-yielding, lower-rated credit securities. The Securities and Exchange Board of
                    India (SEBI) conducted a probe into this sudden closure and found “serious lapses and violations”.
                    As a result, in June 2021, SEBI barred Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund from launching any new debt
                    schemes for two years. The regulator also ordered the fund house to refund investment and advisory
                    fees, along with interest, of more than 5 billion rupees, and fined the global giant another 50
                    million rupees. <sup>[15][16][17][18]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Franklin Templeton said it strongly disagreed with the SEBI’s order and planned to appeal against
                    it. The decision to wind up the schemes “was taken with the sole objective of preserving value for
                    unitholders”, a spokesperson said. However, the closure of these funds sparked panic withdrawals
                    from other Franklin Templeton schemes as well as credit funds of other asset managers, leading to a
                    storm on social media and court cases by distraught investors. <sup>[18][15][17]</sup>

                <h4>Reliance Mutual Fund<sub>[edit]</sub></h4>
                <p>In 2019, the debt schemes of Reliance Mutual Fund faced a liquidity crisis due to their exposure to
                    troubled companies like Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL). This led to severe redemptions and
                    forced asset sales, which significantly affected investors. <sup>[19][20]</sup></p>

                <h4>IL&FS crisis and impact<sub>[edit]</sub></h4>
                <p>The IL&FS crisis in 2018 had a significant impact on the mutual fund industry, including those
                    managed by IDBI Mutual Fund. The defaults by IL&FS led to a series of downgrades and defaults on its
                    debt obligations and inter-corporate deposits1. This situation caused considerable distress in the
                    financial markets and led to significant markdowns in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the affected
                    mutual fund schemes, resulting in losses to investors <sup>[21][22][23]</sup></p>
                <p>The defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) triggered a liquidity crisis,
                    making it difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption demands without selling assets at distressed
                    prices. This event heightened concerns about credit risk, leading to widespread downgrades of IL&FS
                    and other non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). Consequently, the net asset values (NAVs) of
                    mutual funds holding these securities were adversely affected, reflecting the increased credit risk
                    and decreased market confidence<sup>[24][25][26][27]</sup></p>
                <p>Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, particularly those with high exposure to NBFCs and
                    infrastructure debt, was severely undermined. This led to significant outflows as investors moved
                    towards safer and more liquid investment options. In response, the Securities and Exchange Board of
                    India (SEBI) introduced stricter regulations on sectoral exposure, single issuer limits, and the
                    quality of collateral accepted in debt funds to enhance liquidity and reduce risks. Fund managers
                    began focusing on higher-quality assets and improved risk management practices. The crisis
                    underscored the need for better credit assessment and liquidity management, prompting regulatory
                    reforms and a more cautious investment approach within the mutual fund
                    industry.<sup>[24][25][26][27]</sup></p>

                    issues due to exposure to Amtek Auto, which defaulted on its debt in 2015. JP Morgan had to suspend
                    redemptions and impose exit loads to manage the liquidity crisis.<sup>[28][29][30]</sup></p>

                    Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund was the biggest investor in the Essel Group, with an exposure of Rs 2,936
                    crore spread across 28 schemes1. This accounted for almost 37% of the total debt fund exposure to

                <h4>Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis and impact<sub>[edit]</sub></h4>
                <p>The Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis had a profound impact on the Indian mutual fund
                    industry. DHFL's defaults created a severe liquidity crunch, making it difficult for mutual funds to
                    meet redemption pressures without selling assets at heavily discounted prices. This crisis raised
                    significant concerns about the creditworthiness of housing finance companies (HFCs) and non-banking
                    financial companies (NBFCs), leading to downgrades of DHFL's debt instruments and adversely
                    affecting the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these securities.
                    <sup>[32][33][34][35]</sup></p>
                <p>Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, especially those with high exposure to HFCs and NBFCs, was
                    severely shaken, resulting in substantial outflows as investors sought safer investments. In
                    response, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) increased scrutiny and introduced
                    tighter regulations on mutual funds' exposure to individual issuers and sectors to mitigate such
                    risks in the future. Fund managers adjusted their portfolios by shifting towards higher-quality and
                    more liquid assets, reducing exposure to high-risk debt instruments. The crisis underscored the
                    importance of credit quality and liquidity management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more
                    cautious approach within the mutual fund industry. <sup>[32][33][34][35]</sup></p>

                <p>Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) defaulted on its debt obligations in 2019. This
                    event led to significant governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment
                    obligations, prompting the Reserve Bank of India to supersede the Board of Directors of DHFL1. The
                    default affected several mutual funds, including those managed by BNP Paribas Asset Management India
                    Private Limited, which had to mark down the value of their investments in DHFL’s securities.</p>
                <p>The crisis deepened with rating downgrades and write-offs by mutual funds, which had a cumulative
                    exposure of ₹5,336 crore to securities issued by DHFL3. As a result, there was a severe liquidity
                    issue and a drop in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the mutual funds, impacting investors’ returns.
                    DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund, which was a joint venture between DHFL and Pramerica Financial, Inc.,
                    also faced challenges due to the exposure to DHFL’s debt instruments. <sup>[39][40][32][35]</sup>

                <h4>Yes Mutual Fund<sub>[edit]</sub></h4>

                <p>
                    In 2019, Yes Bank faced severe financial stress and was eventually placed under a moratorium by the
                    Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in March 2020.
                    This led to significant challenges for Yes Mutual Fund, particularly its debt schemes that had
                    exposure to Yes Bank’s securities.
                    The crisis necessitated write-downs and affected investor confidence. Around 32 mutual fund schemes
                    had exposure to Yes Bank’s downgraded debt papers, with a total exposure amounting to approximately
                    ₹2,848 crore.
                    The crisis led to write-downs of these securities and impacted the net asset values (NAVs) of the
                    mutual funds involved, which in turn affected investor confidence.

                <p>
                    In 2019, Kotak Mutual Fund did face challenges with its Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) due to exposure
                    to debt securities of companies like the Essel Group.
                    The fund house was unable to redeem investments from these companies, which led to delays and
                    partial rollovers of the FMPs.
                    This situation affected the investors’ expected returns. Consequently, the Securities and Exchange
                    Board of India (SEBI) barred Kotak from launching new FMPs for six months and imposed a fine for
                    failing to abide by regulatory requirements.

                    HDFC Mutual Fund did face a situation in 2018-2019 due to its exposure to companies like Essel Group
                    and IL&amp;FS.
                    The credit events involving these companies led to significant mark-downs in the Net Asset Values
                    (NAVs) of some of HDFC Mutual Fund’s debt schemes.
                    This situation resulted in investor concerns and redemption pressures.

                <p>
                    To elaborate, the IL&amp;FS crisis was one of the biggest financial crises in India, with the
                    company defaulting on several of its obligations due to a cash shortfall.
                    The debt involved was about Rs 1 lakh crore. Similarly, Essel Group companies were grappling with
                    debt woes, which put mutual funds, including HDFC, under redemption pressure.
                    However, HDFC Mutual Fund later recovered the entire investment made in the non-convertible
                    debentures issued by Essel Group companies.

                <p>
                    SEBI conducted an examination to determine whether Sahara Mutual Fund, its Asset Management Company,
                    and its trustees were ‘fit and proper’ as per regulatory standards.
                    This was in light of a previous SEBI order from 2011 concerning two other Sahara entities, which
                    were directed to refund money collected through Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) to
                    investors.
                    <sup>[47][48]</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2015, SEBI ordered the winding up of Sahara Mutual Fund’s schemes due to non-compliance with
                    regulatory requirements.
                    The regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges indeed led to operational difficulties and affected
                    investor confidence in the fund house.
