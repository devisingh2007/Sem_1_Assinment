                alt="taj mahal" height="500" title="Taj Mahal">
            <figcaption>The Taj Mahal in Agra, India, is a stunning masterpiece of Mughal architecture and a symbol of
                eternal love. Crafted from gleaming white marble, its symmetrical design features a grand central dome
                surrounded by four smaller domes and elegant minarets at each corner. The monument is beautifully framed
                by a long reflecting pool and manicured gardens, enhancing its serene and majestic presence. As a UNESCO
                World Heritage Site, the Taj Mahal stands as a testament to India's rich cultural heritage and artistic

            <figcaption>The Stone Chariot at Hampi, Karnataka, is a breathtaking example of ancient Indian craftsmanship
                and architectural brilliance. Nestled within the Vittala Temple complex, this granite marvel is carved
                to resemble a wooden chariot and is flanked by two majestic stone elephants. Set against the backdrop of
                a glowing sunset and partially ruined temple structures, the scene evokes the grandeur of the
                Vijayanagara Empire. Its intricate details and historical significance make it a timeless symbol of
                India's rich cultural legacy.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>The Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga temple in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, stands as a luminous beacon of
                devotion and architectural splendor. Captured at night, its intricately carved spire glows with vibrant
                lights, crowned by a fluttering flag that adds to its sacred aura. As one of the twelve revered
                Jyotirlingas dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple draws countless devotees, especially during festive
                occasions. The surrounding structures and gathering of people reflect its enduring cultural and
                spiritual significance, making it a powerful symbol of India's rich religious heritage.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>The Red Fort, or Lal Qila, in Delhi is a magnificent symbol of India's rich Mughal heritage and
                national pride. Built from striking red sandstone, its architecture showcases elegant domes, arches, and
                intricate carvings. Once the main residence of Mughal emperors, it now serves as a powerful emblem of
                independence, with the Indian flag flying high above its ramparts. Every year, it becomes the focal
                point of India's Independence Day celebrations, echoing the nation's enduring spirit.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>The Statue of Unity, located in Gujarat, India, is the world's tallest statue, standing at an
                impressive 182 meters. It honors Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a key figure in India's independence and
                unification. Set against the scenic backdrop of the Narmada River and lush green hills, the statue not
                only symbolizes national unity but also serves as a major cultural and architectural landmark.

        <p> Audio refers to sound that can be heard by the human ear, typically ranging from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. In
            technology, audio is captured using microphones, converted into digital signals, and stored as files like
            MP3,
            WAV, or AAC. These files can be played back through speakers or headphones using sound cards or embedded
            systems. Audio plays a vital role in communication, entertainment, education, and accessibility—from
            podcasts
            and music to screen readers and voice assistants
