    <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>
    <p><em>Technology has transformed the way we live, work, and connect.</em> This article explores the
        <strong>evolution of computers</strong> and the <mark>birth of the internet</mark>, highlighting key milestones
        and innovations that shaped the digital age.</p>

    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The journey of computing began with <b>mechanical devices</b> like the <i>abacus</i>, used for basic arithmetic.
        In the 19th century, <u>Charles Babbage</u> proposed the <strong>Analytical Engine</strong>, often considered
        the <em>first concept of a programmable computer</em>. His collaborator, <abbr title="Augusta Ada King">Ada
            Lovelace</abbr>, wrote what is now recognized as the <ins>first algorithm</ins>. Early machines relied on
        punch cards and mechanical gears. These inventions laid the foundation for modern computing. <del>Manual
            calculations</del> were gradually replaced by automated processes, revolutionizing science and engineering.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        Computers evolved through distinct generations. The <mark>first generation</mark> used <abbr
            title="Vacuum Tubes">vacuum tubes</abbr>, which were bulky and unreliable. The <i>second generation</i>
        introduced <strong>transistors</strong>, improving speed and efficiency. The <em>third generation</em> brought
        <abbr title="Integrated Circuits">ICs</abbr>, allowing more compact and powerful machines. The <abbr
            title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> became a core component. By the <u>fourth generation</u>,
        microprocessors enabled personal computers. Today’s devices use <sup>nanometer-scale</sup> chips and advanced
        architecture. Each generation marked a leap in <b>performance</b>, <i>accessibility</i>, and
        <strong>affordability</strong>.

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
        The internet began as a military project called <abbr
            title="Advanced Research Projects Agency Network">ARPANET</abbr>. It connected universities and research
        labs, enabling data sharing. In 1989, <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> invented the <abbr
            title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>, introducing <code>HTML</code> and <code>HTTP</code>. This innovation made
        the internet accessible to the public. As Berners-Lee famously said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential
        aspect."
        – <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The internet grew rapidly, connecting billions of people. <em>Email</em>, <mark>search engines</mark>, and
        <strong>social media</strong> transformed communication. <del>Slow dial-up</del> was replaced by
        <ins>broadband</ins> and fiber optics. Today, the internet powers everything from <i>education</i> to
        <b>e-commerce</b>.

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
        In the modern era, computers are everywhere—from desktops to <small>smartphones</small> in our pockets. Cloud
        computing allows data access from anywhere. Artificial Intelligence (<abbr
            title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>) and Machine Learning are reshaping industries. Devices now
        support voice commands like <kbd>Hey Siri</kbd> or <kbd>OK Google</kbd>. Users interact with systems using
        gestures, touch, and voice. For example, pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> copies text, and the system
        responds: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>. The rise of <strong>remote work</strong> and <em>online
            collaboration</em> has made digital literacy essential. Technologies like <var>5G</var> and <var>IoT</var>
        are pushing boundaries further.
    </p>

    <h2>Mathematics in Computing</h2>
    <p>
        Mathematics plays a vital role in computing. One of the most famous equations is: E = mc<sup>2</sup>, which
        relates energy and mass. Chemical formulas like H<sub>2</sub>O represent water. In programming, variables such
        as <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are used to store data. Algorithms often rely on <sup>exponents</sup> and
        <sub>indices</sub> to perform calculations. Understanding these concepts is crucial for <strong>data
            science</strong> and <em>machine learning</em>.

    <h2>Computer Example</h2>
    <p>To display text on a webpage, you can use the following code:</p>
    <pre>
<code>
<html>
  <body>
    <p>Hello World</p>
  </body>
</html>
</code>
  </pre>
    <p>
        This simple example uses <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> to create a paragraph. You can also use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
        <kbd>V</kbd> to paste content. The system might respond with: <samp>Content pasted successfully.</samp>
    </p>
